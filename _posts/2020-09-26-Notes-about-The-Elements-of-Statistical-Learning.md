## Introduction

## Overview of Supervised Learning

### Statistical Decision Theory

Let $X \in \boldsymbol{R}$ denote a real valued random input vector, and $Y \in \boldsymbol{R}$ a real valued random output variable, with joint distribution $Pr(X, Y)$. We seek a function $f(X)$ for predicting $Y$ given values of the input $X$. For the loss function
